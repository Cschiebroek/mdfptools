### DDec Charging Model
In order to use the scikit-learn trained DDec partial charge models, install the [mlddec](https://github.com/hjuinj/mlddec) repository, ~~[git lfs](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation) installation is needed as some of the models are bigger than the single file size restriction set by github (e.g. Carbon model > 400 mb)~~



### TODOs:
- **addition on counter ions**
- error catching for parsing SMILES
- move ddec charging into new repo (done)
